sorting.py - Sorting algorithms for sorting a list of numbers.

This file contains the following sorting algorithms:
    - quicksort: An efficient, recursive algorithm that uses a pivot to partition the array into two halves.
                 Average time complexity is O(n log n), worst-case is O(n^2).
    - bubblesort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
                  and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
    - mergesort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.
                 Time complexity is O(n log n).
    - insertion_sort: A simple algorithm that builds the sorted array one item at a time,
                      by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.
                      Average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
    - selection_sort: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region,
                      and iteratively selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region to place into the sorted region.
                      Time complexity is O(n^2).
    - heap_sort: An efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to create a sorted array.
                 Time complexity is O(n log n).
    - shell_sort: A generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items far apart.
                  The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, taking every h-th element produces a sorted list.
                  Average time complexity is O(n log n).
    - counting_sort: A non-comparison based sorting algorithm that counts the number of occurrences of each unique element.
                     It is efficient for sorting integers within a limited range. Time complexity is O(n + k), where k is the range of the input.
    - radix_sort: A non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits.
                  Time complexity is O(nk), where k is the number of digits.
    - bucket_sort: A distribution-based sorting algorithm that divides the elements into several buckets,
                   sorts each bucket, and then concatenates the results. Time complexity is O(n + k).
    - tim_sort: A hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, used in Pythonâ€™s built-in sorted() function.
                Time complexity is O(n log n).
    - cocktail_sort: A variation of bubble sort that sorts in both directions on each pass through the list.
                     Average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
    - gnome_sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that is similar to insertion sort but uses a different approach for sorting.
                  Average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
    - bitonic_sort: A parallel sorting algorithm that works by dividing the array into bitonic sequences and merging them.
                    Time complexity is O(log^2 n) in parallel computing.
    - pancake_sort: A sorting algorithm that uses a series of flips to sort an array, similar to sorting pancakes by size.
                    Time complexity is O(n).
    - cycle_sort: An in-place, non-comparison based sorting algorithm that is optimal in terms of the number of writes.
                  Time complexity is O(n^2).
    - stooge_sort: A recursive sorting algorithm that sorts in O(n^(log 3 / log 1.5)) time, primarily for educational purposes.
    - strand_sort: A stable sorting algorithm that recursively builds a sorted list from the input list by removing "strands" of sorted elements.
                   Average time complexity is O(n^2).
    - bogo_sort: A highly ineffective sorting algorithm that randomly permutes the array until it is sorted.
                 Average time complexity is O((n + 1)!) and is impractical for real sorting tasks.
    - sleep_sort: A joke sorting algorithm that sleeps for a duration proportional to the value of each element.
                  Time complexity is unbounded due to sleep time.
    - gravity_sort: A non-standard, humorous sorting algorithm that simulates the effect of gravity on balls of different weights.
                    Time complexity is not defined.
    - quantum_bogo_sort: A theoretical sorting algorithm that uses quantum mechanics to sort the elements, not practically feasible.
                          Time complexity is unbounded.
    - miracle_sort: A humorous concept that suggests a sorting algorithm that sorts elements instantly.
                    Time complexity is not defined.
